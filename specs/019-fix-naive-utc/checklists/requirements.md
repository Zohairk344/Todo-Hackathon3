# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Naive UTC Timestamps

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-13
**Feature**: [specs/019-fix-naive-utc/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) *Exception: Technical bug fix requires specific Python datetime logic*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification *Exception: See Content Quality*

## Notes

- This spec addresses a technical bug fix (timezone handling) and thus contains specific Python logic references (e.g., `datetime.utcnow`) which are essential for the fix.
